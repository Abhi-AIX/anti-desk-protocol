### Step-by-Step Guide

1.  **Chin Tucks:** Sit or stand up straight. Gently tuck your chin towards your chest, creating a "double chin." You should feel a stretch at the back of your neck. Hold for 5 seconds.
2.  **Chest Stretch:** Stand in a doorway and place your forearms on the frame, with your elbows slightly below shoulder height. Step forward with one foot until you feel a stretch in your chest and the front of your shoulders. Hold for 30 seconds.
3.  **Upper Trapezius Stretch:** Gently pull your head towards one shoulder until you feel a stretch on the opposite side of your neck. Hold for 30 seconds on each side.

**Frequency:** Perform these stretches 2-3 times throughout your workday.

- **Mindful Posture:** Be conscious of your posture while sitting and standing. Keep your ears aligned with your shoulders.
